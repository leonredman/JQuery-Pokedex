#  POKEDEX JAVASCRIPT/JQUERY/AJAX API PROJECT


This project was built with the javascript library JQuery with AJAX, and the pokemeon API  https://pokeapi.co/ to focus on get requests and working with
data on front end.  The UI was inspired by a React project from Codepen.io. I basically desconstructed the react project and re-created it with JQuery.
